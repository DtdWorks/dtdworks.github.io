Before using the FACEGLOW APP, please read these terms of use carefully. These terms govern your use of the FACEGLOW APP, a service distributed through the App Store, referred to as "Service."

By using this Service on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other device (collectively referred to as "Device"), you, as the user of the Service, confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms of use and any applicable laws.

**Welcome to our service (referred to as "we" or "our"), provided by Happy Plan. For inquiries regarding data protection, please contact us  at [support@faceglowapp.com](mailto:support@faceglowapp.com).**

We reserve the right to change these terms of use at any time without prior notice, and they will become effective after being posted in the application. Continuing to use the Service will be deemed as your acceptance of the modified terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms of use, please refrain from using the Service.

## **License Scope**

According to these terms of use, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license for personal, non-commercial use of the Service. This license does not allow you to use the Service on devices you do not own or legally control, nor can you provide the Service to a network that can use multiple devices simultaneously. Renting, leasing, lending, selling, redistributing, or re-licensing the Service is not permitted. You may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to export the source code of the website or application, modify or create derivative works, or modify or create portions of the content unless explicitly allowed by the terms of the certification application store from which you downloaded the application, or unless otherwise expressly prohibited by applicable law. Any attempt to do so will infringe upon our rights as licensors and may result in legal action and damages.

## **Intellectual Property**

All intellectual property on the Service, including materials protected by copyright, trademark, or patent law, is either owned by us or owned by third parties. All trademarks, service marks, and business names are either owned, registered, or licensed by us. All content provided by the Service (excluding personal information), including but not limited to text, software, scripts, code, design, graphics, photos, sound, music, videos, applications, interactive features, and all other content (hereinafter referred to as "Content"), is our intellectual property, and all rights are reserved.

## **Privacy**

To use the Service, you may be required to provide certain personal information. Your provision of personal information is governed by our privacy policy, and by using the Service, you consent to the collection of such information. Therefore, please ensure that you have read the provisions of our privacy policy carefully.

## **Links**

The Service may contain links to websites, applications, or other products or services operated by other companies (referred to as "Third-Party Services"). We do not endorse, monitor, or have any control over these Third-Party Services, which have separate terms of use and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or policies of Third-Party Services, and you access these Third-Party Services at your own risk.

## **Unauthorized Use**

You may not use the Service or submit content to us or the Service or to any user of the Service in any manner that:

- Violates any applicable laws, regulations, or rules in any jurisdiction;
- Constitutes fraud, criminal activity, or illegal conduct;
- Provides inaccurate or outdated information;

- Violates any specific rules or requirements set forth by us in specific parts of the Service or the Service in general;
- Involves your use, delivery, or transmission of any viruses or any intention to damage, interfere with, intercept, or usurp any system, data, or personal information.

## **Fees and Payment**

The Service offers subscriptions for Content (as defined in the "Intellectual Property" section) and can be purchased as follows:

- Through the application ("In-App Purchase").

Specific terms of purchase apply depending on the purchase option you select.

With In-App Purchase, you acquire the right to Content (subscription). To access purchases in the application, use your user account credentials.

**In-App Purchase:**

By purchasing a subscription to Content through the application, you will pay the applicable fees (and any related taxes) disclosed to you by the application store from which you downloaded the application.

- Subscriptions renew automatically. You must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends or before the current subscription period ends. If you don't know how to cancel a subscription or a free trial, please visit the Apple Support website (or any other application store's support page). Deleting the application will not cancel your subscription and free trial.
- To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will provide you with reasonable notice of such pricing changes by posting new prices on the application and/or by sending email notifications. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you may cancel the relevant subscription before the changes take effect.
- By subscribing to certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may automatically renew. Unless you cancel the subscription, you authorize the application store(s) to charge you during the renewal period. The term of automatic renewal will be the same as your initial subscription term, unless the application informs you of rate changes before the automatic renewal. You must cancel your subscription according to the cancellation procedure disclosed to you for the specific subscription. We will not refund charges already posted to your account, and we do not prorate fees for canceled subscriptions.
- The Service and your rights to use the Service expire at the end of your subscription period. If you do not pay the fees or charges when due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue, but we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Service, even without advance notice.
- In addition to purchasing subscriptions, you may be offered additional purchases to receive additional fees. Such purchases are optional and do not affect the conditions of your subscription. If you choose to purchase any additional items, you will be charged the relevant fees as indicated on the purchase screen. Unlike subscriptions, additional items are one-time lifetime purchases and cannot be canceled. Additional items do not

offer a free trial.

- You authorize the application store to charge the payment card submitted by you. Subscriptions purchased through the application store are subject to the refund policy of the application store. This means that we cannot provide refunds. You must contact the application store support department.
